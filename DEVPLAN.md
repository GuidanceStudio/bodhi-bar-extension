# Devplan — Fix workspace restore duplicating groups

## Problem

When restoring a workspace, tab groups get duplicated (tripled in the reported case).
The browser's tab strip shows e.g. Tech×3, Office×3, Comms×3 instead of one of each.

### Root causes

1. **Placeholder tab never removed** — created to prevent 0-tab window, but never deleted. *(Fixed in M1-M3)*
2. **No concurrency guard** — restore could run in parallel. *(Fixed in M1)*
3. **Brave ghost groups** — Brave may not destroy groups on bulk tab remove. *(Fixed in M4)*
4. **Corrupted workspace data** — If the workspace was saved AFTER a previous buggy restore, the payload itself contains tripled groups. Every subsequent restore faithfully recreates them. *(Fixed in M5+M6)*

---

## M1 — Add concurrency guard to APPLY_WORKSPACE ✅

- [x] `restoreInProgress` flag + `finally` block
- [x] Disable confirm buttons in popup after click

## M2 — Verify tab closure before creating new tabs ✅

- [x] Re-query after `chrome.tabs.remove()`, retry once, abort if tabs survive

## M3 — Clean up placeholder tab after restore ✅

- [x] `chrome.tabs.remove(placeholderTabId)` instead of move-to-end

## M4 — Explicitly destroy groups before closing tabs (Brave fix) ✅

- [x] `chrome.tabs.ungroup()` on all grouped tabs before closing

## M5 — Deduplicate groups in payload before restore ✅

- [x] In `APPLY_WORKSPACE`, after parsing `allTabGroups`, merge groups that share the same `title` + `color` key
- [x] Combine their `tabs` arrays (deduplicate by URL to avoid duplicate tabs within the merged group)
- [x] Log a warning when dedup occurs so the user knows the snapshot was dirty

## M6 — Deduplicate on save (prevent corruption at source) ✅

- [x] In `buildExportPayload()`, after building `allTabGroups`, merge groups with same title+color
- [x] Deduplicate tabs by URL within each merged group
